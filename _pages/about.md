She is majorly working around the ideas that intersect Language, Cognition and Machine Intelligence. She has been a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern in 2020 at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada under [Prof. Darren Ambrason]() where she worked on preparing the datasets to fine-tune State-Of-The-Art Language Models to perform Compositional Tasks in Natural Language Understanding and getting results on benchmark datasets (Super-GLUE) for Common-Sense-Reasoning Tasks using Zero-Shot Measurements. Recently, she worked as a Data Science Intern at [Emplay, Dublin, CA], contributing to developing keyphrases generation api end-to-end and creating models to detect toxicity in user's feed for fortune 500 clients.
She has been a memeber of the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Biomedical and Human Factors Engineering](https://www.amu.ac.in/amucentre.jsp?did=10234) directed by [Prof. Yusuf Uzzaman Khan](https://www.amu.ac.in/dshowfacultydata.jsp?did=31&eid=3111) who has also been her thesis-advisor.
