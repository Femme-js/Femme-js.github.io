Hi! I am Jeevanshi, an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Alberta, specializing in Multimedia. I hold a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from [Aligarh Muslim University](https://amu.ac.in/colleges/zakir-husain-college-of-engineering-and-technology), India, graduating in 2022.

Currently, I am a Co-op Machine Learning Engineering Intern at Okaki Health Intelligence, where I build AI-driven NLP systems for healthcare. I have also worked as an Outreachy Intern with the Ersilia Open Source Initiative, developing AI/ML tools for drug discovery. My previous experience includes a Mitacs Globalink Research Internship at Dalhousie University where I worked on common-sense reasoning in NLP and a Data Science Internship at Emplay, where I contributed to keyphrase generation APIs and content moderation.

Beyond technology, I deeply value diverse human experiences. My background in theatre and the arts, alongside my passion for music, history, philosophy, and psychology, shapes my unique approach to problem-solving. These interests fuel my desire to understand the human brain and life itself. I am passionate about integrating machine intelligence with human experience. My goal is to design AI systems that are culturally sensitive and attuned to human needs, drawing from my artistic background and principles of aesthetics.
