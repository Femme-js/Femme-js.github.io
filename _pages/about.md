Hi! I am Jeevanshi, an incoming MSc CS grad student at University of Alberta. I have graduated as an Electrical Engineer graduate from [Aligarh Muslim University](https://amu.ac.in/colleges/zakir-husain-college-of-engineering-and-technology), India in 2022.

Recently, I worked as an Outreachy Intern with Ersilia Open Source Initiative, contributing in development of AI/ML tools for drug discovery. I have been a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at Dalhousie University in the year 2020.  I have worked as a Data Science Intern at [Emplay, Dublin, CA](https://www.emplay.net/), contributing to developing keyphrases generation api and content moderation. 

I take a deep appreciation in diverese human experiences. I myself coming from a theatre and arts background apart from my formal education, I later grew up my deep interest and passion into music, history, philosophy, analytical psychology, etc which continuosly feeds my desire to understand life and human brain. My interests have allowed me to create unique and more holistic approaches to problem-solving. 

I look forward to work on the ideas that integrates machine intelligence and human experience generally. Drawing on the principles of aesthetics, and my keen sense of artistry and creativity, I aim to design AI systems that are culturally sensitive and more attuned to human needs.
