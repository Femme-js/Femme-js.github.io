SHe is majorly working around the ideas that intersect Language, Cognition and Machine Intelligence. She has been a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern in 2020, 


and is a member of the <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/amucentre.jsp?did=10234" target="_blank">Centre for Interdisciplinary Biomedical and Human Factors Engineering </a> directed by <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/dshowfacultydata.jsp?did=31&eid=3111" target="_blank">Professor Yusuf Uzzaman Khan</a>. Currently, I am working as a Research Intern under Prof. <a href="https://xulabs.github.io/" target="_blank">Darren Abramson</a>, Dalhousie University, Canada remotely. My contribution has been in working with datasets for Compositional Tasks in Natural Language Understanding, preparing them for pretraining of State-Of-The-Art Language Models. I have also contributed in getting the results on Benchmark Datasets for Common-Sense-Reasoning Tasks using Zero-Shot Measurements.


Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
